# Developing

## Requirements
- [qemu-arm-static](http://packages.debian.org/sid/qemu-user-static)
- [CustomPiOS](https://github.com/guysoft/CustomPiOS)
- [Downloaded Raspbian Image](http://www.raspbian.org/)
- Bash
- Git
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)
- [Docker-Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- QEMU for emulation
- About 5GB of free diskspace for the build

### Packages for Ubuntu 18.04/20.04
** Dekstop variants are known to cause issues during build due to snaps takeing up loop mounts **
```bash
sudo apt-get install gawk make build-essential util-linux \
qemu-user-static qemu-system-arm \
git p7zip-full python3 curl
```

## Compiling source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/raymondh2/HullOS.git
cd HullOS/
make build
```

### Other make options
```bash
make clean - Clean all previous build items except the source raspian image
make distclean - Clean up the source image and trigger a new download
```

### Build layout
HullOS/emulation - Contains dependencies for emulation testing  
HullOS/src/image - Contains our base raspbian image  
HullOS/src/workspace - Created during build, and output for compiled images
